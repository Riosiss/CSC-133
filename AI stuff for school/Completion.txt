model: gpt-3.5-turbo

This will be something later. "Now this is Gorgos, who drove to Gogona rather than Gonia, even though he swallowed no grapes or any wine with the cup of faith. My father went to Gogona, not Gonia. And I'm bringing grapes back to show you what I've learned. Bring a cup to me and I'll bring grapes to you. Strive to strive. It's true. To attain God life, giving and receiving and thus assembly experience by association with the God of our forefathers. Look at this one, look at this one. "Have received the cup and given it to them also good wine to drink. My father's deeds bear fruit and the God-given wisdom grow within you and mine, to make most richly joyful in virtue and peace willing to share unsparingly. And so this is enough. Sorrow and dire forsaken, receive and give and come." Well, I understand we have no more now. Because they haven't been got. But now Osiris is coming here. So we leave this place and we go to the door. And in we proceed and I wish you could open the door. Although I don't think it's done now that we laugh so hard when we see that when we go into a door, it opens and keeps on opening and it draws in an angel that says, "You have no life in you." But my father and Nephew and myself and Tiphareth in all of our brothers who have gone before us have given eternal life to all of us. So there he has gone. And now a new life he begins. And now the nifty trap in the magnetic trap is he who is all-universal life and man in heaven. So thanks to all those of you who have been holding this course for you have been very good students. Please be at the door now and let's go in and let's be saved. Thank you.

Beautiful there. It's a little short, I would say, so...

No, that's great. I think that that's... there's a correct pride there. It's very good to have lessons of that. And, you know, it's like those students who don't want to go back to college or engineering school or whatever. They come in initially and they think they can be the largest number, so...

And if they would pay their money, they would get the degree right here for them in this course.

But that's so the... I wouldn't have to do it.

Yeah. That's true.

They would. Who would?

Man. Well, I was looking for meaning to get there for laughter, acted true, that it's only in real laughter that there's real joy.

That's right. That's right. Boy, [inaudible] father.

Yes.

This lesson sort of gives us something to do. It just flits through us like that.

It seems like it's a very small tap, and yet it moves us all a little bit. So it's a good thing to...

Oh, yeah.

So we'll go on here, Heber, and we'll just spend some time. All right, let's get rid of that story that's in there right now. And here is one that we have done already, what was here?

Before Peter James Jones left us as a recipient and scholastic Guardian of the Tao and O, the Angel of Yin, the Angel of Father and Mother and Earth.

Praise to your Lord Jesus Christ, the Spirit of the Light by whom all things were created in the Tao, when God created the universe. He chose the subtle matter, for neither an angel or a man became less for his union with the divine Spirit. This book produced at the feet of the Lord, therefore, is called holy, for the thing itself has been so separated. From all great and little things that walls have sometimes been made around it. We can say something of the integrity with which a law prevents a secret from being missed. This is a word of truth, for truth once upholds the power of spirit, and spirit once upholds the integrity of our truths. By its true form and by its work performed are not removed from this, and therefore let me officially for the time being, so say, write another of the simplest words with truth and cause all men and women as its first form and its first work. Establish a word or content so pure that no interference with its spirit shall be tolerated, an interference from any type whatsoever, but that said person shall be used within that earth as one glorified or one who brings and is glorified, so that this wisdom may act or bring forth truth among all peoples and peoples of all kinds. This is the first principle of primordial Love and the foundations of our society. And from this a law assigns us to love each other. This principle must never be violated, for it is that to which the body of heaven and the soul of grounds are reconciled. And the principle of the gity, thank you, is invented from the essence and form of life, which is the pride of a man or a woman and by his or her maker. And then he could go on and then I'll let you sample these folks because there's a lot of young people here.

Amen.

Amen. But what are we to do? I must resort to the observations of angelic time, for the soul of man is to be a dwelling place in which the word of consciousness, which is the consciousness of all souls, may be lived and experienced, for the consciousness organizes the sharply blackened dust and darkness which is caused by sin cannot pass up through the archenesis, a soul living without it. The purpose of this sin is for a soul to gain knowledge and knowledge of truth as eternal leisure and wisdom. This is the purpose of the erroneous acts of all according to the decrees of angelic authority.

Good.

Oh, thanks.

Right on there, so we, oh.

Okay, beloved, take a moment now for our opening figures so we can dive into this and this will open in a few moments. (upbeat music)

All right, so look at the beautiful faces. Those are the acolytes, those are the 12 probably that kind of went in before that.

Okay.

That's awesome, thank you so much.

Thank you.

Thank you for hosting us. (laughing)

Peace, peace.

Okay, so this is a very memorable family. So I'm going to read this one. To mother, I wish to affirm the end this is first lesson sounds very similar to what we're beginning tonight even the values. First of all, your labor is obligatory and most impor, your labor has been obligatory from time, that's cool, that's the word for labor.

Without vocation.

Yeah, so this is right there in there, your limitless labor. It has been obligated and most impor, meaning the McTaggart will it have been the

assistant output summary1:

The first lesson in the text is about the importance of labor and how it is an obligation for a mother. The text also mentions the limitless nature of a mother's labor and how it is a vital part of the McTaggart's will.

assistant output summary2: "what was the religious part?"
The religious aspect of the text is not very clear, as the focus is more on the labor of a mother rather than any specific religious doctrine or belief. However, there is a mention of the McTaggart's will, which may imply a connection to a higher power or divine plan.
